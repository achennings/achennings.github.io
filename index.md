## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="face.jpg">

Postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, member of the [Princeton Computational Memory lab](https://compmem.princeton.edu/) led by Dr. Ken Norman. Currently supported by an F32 NRSA fellowship from the NIMH.

I am currently on the academic job market! Please feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:gus.hennings@princeton.edu), or follow me on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gushennings.bsky.social).

My interests include:
- studying learning and memory in humans
- obsessing over graph aesthetics
- spending time with my dogs

## Research Statement

My research investigates the neurobiological and cognitive mechanisms of affective processes in humans, as well as how these mechanisms contribute to the etiology and maintenance of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. I leverage these findings to test novel, neuroscience-informed interventions in healthy and clinical populations. I use behavioral and physiological assessment, advanced fMRI analyses including real-time neurofeedback, eye-tracking, and computational modeling to advance this research.
