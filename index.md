## Research Statement

The broad goal of my research is to leverage insights from episodic memory to better understand emotional associative learning. I use Pavlovian threat learning and extinction as experimental models of PTSD and exposure therapy, respectively. My PhD focused on describing how episodic-like contextual processes govern the retrieval of, and competition between, associative memories of threat and safety. Currently, I am exploring how  real-time fMRI neurofeedback can be used to enhance the efficacy of extinction learning in humans. The ultimate goal of this work is to improve clinical outcomes of individuals suffering from PTSD.
